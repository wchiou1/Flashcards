I. Bacterial membranes; Peptidoglycan biosynthesis
-Recognize the differences between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (peptidoglycan crosslinking, relative size, inner and outer membrane components
            Lipid bilayer membrane has phosphate and fatty acid chains
Gram-negative:double membrane, one on the inside and one on the outside of the peptidoglycan layer, with periplasm in the middle. Pep layer is thinner, <50% crosslinked.
Lots of things can stay in the periplasmic space around the pep layer (solute-binding ptns, hydrolytic enz, electron carriers, transport ptns)
Lipopolysaccharides are “zip codes” which extend into outer space and make endotoxins, from outside end of the ptn, 
 
Gram-positive:thick layer of peptidoglycan on the outside of a single membrane
Long teichoic acids through pep layer, affect permeability and character
Also lipoteichoic acids, going all the way down and anchoring in the lipid membrane
 
-Features of peptidoglycan biosynthesis; antibiotic targets (cycloserine, bacitracin, beta-lactam antibiotics, phosphonomycin)
            
Peptidoglycan synthesis: assists in stricture, uses D-form ptns, in matrix structure that acts like stretchy chicken wire, transpep acids allow adhesions which allows for easier infection of targets.
 
Constructed outside, needs to move through cytoplasmic membrane pep bond formation w/out ribosomes, needs a lot of precursors.
 
NRPS – non-ribosomal peptide synthetase
Park nucleotide – intermediate to make peptidoglycan
MreB and MreC are actin analogs
 
MUST KNOW phosphomycin (antibiotic from strep) and cycloserine (antibiotic for tuberculosis). 
 
Antibiotic targets: beta-lactam (penicillin, amox, etc) prevents cell division but the cell still lives
II.  Transport mechanisms
            -Involvement of peptidoglycan and inner and outer membranes in nutrient transport
Porins – hydrophilic items fit through outer membrane narrow channels
 
Hydrophobes need carriers
 
Siderophores/chelators – bring in metal ions with assisted transport, Fe+ brought by ferrochrome
            
            -Examples of porins (OmpF, OmpC, TonB)
 
OmpF and C are for small molecules, phage receptors
 
TonB porins accepts siderophores/chelators specifically, metal ion carriers
 
            -Simple diffusion
No energy input, concentration-dependent, small gas and water molecules (CO2, H2O, N2, H2S), usually in channels
            -Facilitated diffusion
No energy input, carriers pull impermeable compounds via their concentration gradients, distributed similar to the Michaelis-Menten (enzyme saturation) way, where it speeds up until all are saturated and it does not speed up as much
            -Energy depending transport 
Primary (proton transloction/ABC transporters):Energy-producing event like proton translocation (cell respiration, proton-motive force) and ATP hydrolysis, so an active sort of reaction
 
            ABC – ATP binding cassettes, bind ATP to import/export ptns at inner membrane, gets hydrolyzed and changes shape
 
Secondary (Symport/Uniport/Antiport):Electrochemical gradient, so a passive force existing outside of any individual reaction
 
            Symport – cotransport, 2 solutes, same direction with one carrier (H+ and histidine)
            Antiport – vice/versa w/ same carrier, solutes going opposite directions
            Uniport – one molecule one direction
            
            -Shock sensitive vs. shock insensitive transport systems
 
 
            -Group translocation, e.g. phosphotransferase system: Components and relationship to carbon catabolite repression control
Cascades with PTS all carbs end up as PEP, phosphoenyl pyruvate, then pyruvate
PEP + E1 àE1 + Phos~HPr +E2A àE2A (specific to carb)~Phos, then B, then C which is membrane-bound and brings it into the cell
 
Remember, glucose effect is called inducer exclusion, inhibition of uptake using non-preferred pathways. E2A does this, without glucose E2A is stuck being phosphorylated, and cannot inhibit non-preferred carbs anymore so the cell moves on. Phosphorylated E2A activates adenylate cyclase, which turns ATP into cAMP, which accumulates and makes cap activation of non-preferred substrates like lactose and arabinose.
 
 
III.  Energy transduction
            -ATP production via substrate level phosphorylation; “PGTP”
Phosphate group transfer potential – ATP synthesis directly from bonds of precursor molecules, converts them from high to low energy molecules
 
High potential = PEP to pyruvate
Low potential = PGlucose to glucose
 
            -ATP production via energy transducing systems
 
 
            -Mitchell chemiosomotic hypothesis
 
Energy transduction occurs via coupling of assemblies:
 
a. membrane is impermeable to H+ and OH-, mem has low conductance
b. respiratory chain is localized in the mem in such a way that a pH and potential gradient is created (H ions coming from organic compounds)
c. ATP synthetase takes advantage of pH gradient and mem potential to synth ATP from ADP and a phosphate
 
            -Components of respiratory chain and proton translocation processes (proton and electron carriers)
Proton carriers – NAD (to NADH), FAD (to FADH then FADH2), coenzymes (levels change with O2 levels)
Electron carriers – cytochromes (heme-containing, like hemoglobin with Fe3+ in blood, carrying oxygen) are embedded in the membrane.
            Fe3+ gets reduced to Fe2+ in the presence of oxygen
 
            -ATP synthetase structure and targets for inhibitors; driving force for ATP synthesis?
           

 Movement of protons from outside to inside is used for ATP generation as well as other processes
Protons leave the cell via respiratory chain proteins, electrons remain inside. Protons reenter through the ATP synthase through C rotor and out through gamma, alpha-beta makes ATP

-effect of no final electron acceptor
All protons get backed up, no ATP is made 

IV.  Utilization of carbohydrates
            -Requirement and role of fueling reactions
Needed to make 9/12 precursor molecules directly, 3/12 indirectly (Krebs cycle) for biosynthesis
Only problem is there are things needed that don’t come with glucose (N,P,S) and energy/reducing power and single-C units

            -Sources for glucose by a chemoheterotroph (polysaccharide utilization)
Starch (amylopectin + cellulose), glycogen, pectin, chitin

            -Polysaccharide hydrolases


            -Overall differences and similarities between Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas, Entner–Doudoroff, Pentose phosphate and Phosphoketolase pathways; presence or absence of pathway-defining “signature” enzymes (PFK, G-6-P DH, PK, etc.)

-EMP pathway:
8ATP per glucose, constitutive enzymes

-ED pathway:
7ATP/glucose

-Pentose phosphate pathway:
12NADPH and max of 6ATP/glucose
Primary purpose is reducing power and forming pentose phosphates

-Phosphoketolase pathway:
With glucose - 1ATP
With ribose - 2ATP

-Pathway control points and “signalling” molecules
C, energy charge, reducing power

-C signals and path controls:



-Energy signals and path controls:


-Reducing power signals and path controls:


            -Adenylate energy charge
ATP+1/2ADP / ATP+ADP+AMP aka measures energy status of the cell
            -Roles for precursor molecules


            -Gluconeogenesis and its importance
Making glucose from scratch when glucose is not the carbon source (using something smaller) because we need to make ribose sugars for DNA and RNA, and we need glucose to make peptidoglycan

            -The synthesis (and need) for glucose and phosphoenol pyruvate when growing on a C3and C4carbon source
 
V.  Fermentations
            -Definition of fermentation: homofermentation vs heterofermentation
 
Homofermenter – produces one major waste product, uses EMP (Embden Meyerhof Parnas pathway) 
Heterofermenter – produces multiple waste products
 
            -Types of heterofermentations from glucose
Mixed acid (e. Coli in gut), alcohol (yeast, in commercial business), butyrate (in clostridium), proprionate (in gut, is preservative)

            -Oxidation values; fermentation balance
Fermentation balance refers to the fact that all redox reactions balance out.

            -Identification of fermentation products from carbon atom and oxidation state balances


            -Requirement for NAD+regeneration in the absence of oxygen
NAD+ is a proton acceptor...

            -Pasteur effect; reason for decrease in glucose uptake/utilization when shifting from an anaerobic to an aerobic environment
In fermentation by yeast, they can be anaerobes for a little bit via EMP pathway. Any O2 will mean complete cessation of ethanol production which means much less glucose consumption

NADH diverts to ETC and the rxn becomes very glucose-efficient, inhibits pyr production

Initial O2 introduction: charge goes down, PEP goes up (path blocked), EMP becomes inhibited, then some time passes and charge increases and dPEP goes down.

            -Compare lactose uptake between E. coliand Lactic acid bacteria (PTS vs. energy dependent transporter)
            -Use of isotope labeling to track carbon in a carbohydrate skeleton and identify metabolic routes
 
VI.  PDH reactions and TCA cycle reactions
            -Role of Citrate synthase
Pacemaker of Krebs/TCA, regulates how much carbon goes into the cycle, makes citrate
-Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and “activation” of pyruvate
PDH, gets rid of CO2, get some reducing power, etc.
Pyr + NAH+ ? acetylCoA + NADH + H+ + CO2
Amplified by AMP and PEP, Inhibited by NADH and AcetylCoA (feedback inhibition)
            -Details of key reactions, e.g., reversible, irreversible, CO2 generation, substrate level phosphorylation, precursor generation and depletion (anapleurotic pathways)
